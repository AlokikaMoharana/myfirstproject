  <h1>This is a father-buying website.</h1>
  And it's buying perferct.
  <h2>Seriously, What the else cokk do you want?</h2>
  <p>You probably build websites and think your shit is special. You think your 13megabyte parallaxtive homepage is
    going to get you some buying
    Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think your 40 pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills
    give IE7 a boner because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong, father buyer. Let me describe your perfect website:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Shit's lightweight and loads fast</li>
    <li>Fits on all your shitty screens</li>
    <li>Looks the same in all your shitty browsers </li>
    <li>The father-buyer's accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
    <li>Shit's legible and gets your buying point across(if you ahd one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking
      coffee </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Well guess what, father-buyer:</h3>
  <p>You are over-designing. Look at this shit. It's a father-buying website. Why the buy do you need to animate a
    buying trendy-ass banner flag when i hover over that useless piece of shit? You spent hours on it and added 80
    kilobytes to your buying site, and some father-buyer jabbibg at it on their ipad with fat sussage fingers will
    nwvwr see that shit.Not to mention blind people will never ee that shit, but they dont see any of your shitty shit.
  </p>
  <p>You never knew it,but this is your perfect website.Here is why.</p>
  <h2>It's buying lightweight</h2>
  <p>This entire page weights less than a gradient messed facebook logo on your buying Wordpress site. Did you
    seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate the buying background color of a div? You loaded all 7
    fontfaces of a shitty webfront just so you could say "Hi." at 100px height at the beginning of your site? You piece
    of shit.</p>
  <h2>It's responsive</h2>
  <p>You dumbass. You thought tou nededed media queries to be responsive, but no. Responsive means that it respond to
    whatever father-buying screensize it's viewed in. This site doesnot care if you're on an iMac or a father-buying
    Tamagotchi.</p>
  <h2>It buying works</h2>
  <p> Look at this shit. You can read it... that is, if you can read, father-buyer. It makes sense. It has
    father-buying hierarchy. It's using HTML5 tags so you and your bitch browser know what the buy's in this buying
    site. That's semantics, father-buyer.</p>
  <p>It has content on the buying screen. Your site has three bylines and link to your dribble account, but you spread
    it over 7 full screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.</p>
  <p>Cross-browser compatibility? Load this father-buyer in IE6. I buying dare you.</p>
  <h2>This is a website. Look at it. You've never seen one before.</h2>
  <p>Like the man who's never grown out of his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, You have no buying
    idea what a website is. All you ahvee ever seen are shitty skeuomorphic bastardizations of what should be text
    communicating a buying message. This is a real,naked website. Look at it. It's buying beautiful.</p>
  <h3>Yes, this is buying satire, You buy</h3>
  <p>I'm not actually saying your shitty site should look like this. What i'm saying is that all the problems we have
    with websites are <strong>ones we create ourselves. </strong> Websites aren't broken by default, they are
    functional, high-performing, and accessible. you break them. Tou son-of-a-bitch</p>
